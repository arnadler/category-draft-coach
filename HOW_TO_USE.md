## Before Your Draft

### 1. Set Up Your League Settings

Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the top right corner.

- **Number of Teams:** Set this to match your league (usually 10 or 12)
- **Categories:** Make sure the scoring categories match your league (R, HR, RBI, SB, AVG, W, SV, K, ERA, WHIP, etc.)
- **Roster Slots:** Adjust if your league has different roster sizes

Click **Save** when done.

## During Your Draft

### Adding Players You Draft

When you draft a player:

1. **Quick Add (Easiest):** Type the player's name in the search bar at the top and press Enter
2. **Or Browse:** Scroll through the player list on the left side and click on a player, then click "My Pick"

### Marking Players Other Teams Draft

When someone else drafts a player:

1. Find the player in the list on the left
2. Click on them
3. Click "Other Team" - this removes them from the available pool without adding them to your roster

### Understanding the Screen

The screen has three main sections:

| Left Side | Middle | Right Side |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Available Players | Your Roster + Category Scores | Recommended Picks |

### Reading Your Category Scores (Middle Section)

- **Green bars** = You're doing well in that category
- **Red bars** = You need help in that category
- The app automatically weighs categories where you're behind more heavily

### Following the Recommendations (Right Side)

The app shows you the **Top 5 Best Picks** based on your current roster. Each recommendation shows:

- The player's name and position
- How much they'll help your overall team score
- Which specific categories they help (like "+0.45 SB" or "+0.22 ERA")

**Tip:** You don't have to follow the recommendations exactly - they're suggestions to help you make informed decisions!

## Helpful Tips

1. **Don't worry about saving** - Your draft progress is automatically saved in your browser. You can close the tab and come back later.

2. **Balance is key** - The app helps you build a balanced roster rather than being great at some categories and terrible at others.

3. **Position scarcity matters** - Catchers and shortstops are harder to find, so the app gives them a small boost.

4. **Use on a laptop/computer** - The site works best on a larger screen during your draft.
